# My studies
A repository that I'm updating as time goes on.

The reason I made this is because I oftentimes find my notes to be disorganized. I usually take notes on a blank sheet of paper, the notes app on my phone or in a Markdown file on my pc; this is my effort eliminate disorganization and keep my notes in a centralized repository.

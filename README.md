# Introduction
The reason I made this is because I oftentimes find my notes to be disorganized. I usually take notes on a blank sheet of paper, the notes app on my phone or in a Markdown file on my pc; this is my effort eliminate disorganization and keep my notes in a centralized repository.

These notes are intended to be public so that if someone finds value in these, he is free to use them.
